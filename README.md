# <JavaScript Built Quiz>

## Description

Have some spare time on your hands? Give this quiz a try! In this challenge we were to use javascript to create a functioning quiz with multiple questions, a timer, and keep score. At the end, we were to create a submit text entry point where the user can store their score locally.
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am currently still trying to figure out how to implement the score keeper function as well as get the submit entry to work. 

## Installation

Below are the installation steps:
1. Create your variables. 
2. Decide on what functions are needed and write out your skeleton functions as placeholders to return to
3. Begin diving into the function arguments.
4. Make sure to create a function that actually runs the code you are trying to create. Otherwise nothing will execute!

## Usage

This can be used to create a random password with user specified criteria. You can choose the length, whether or not you want numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or special characters!
